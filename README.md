# Creating Tables and Writing Queries using SQL

1. **Creating and Populating Tables**

   **Objective:**

   - Set up a simple table, insert data, and retrieve that data using basic queries.

   **Requirements:**

   - Use `CREATE TABLE` to define a table (e.g., `Employees` or `Products`) with appropriate data types and constraints.
   - Populate the table using `INSERT INTO` with multiple rows of sample data.
   - Execute a basic `SELECT * FROM TableName;` query to verify the data insertion.

2. **Basic Filtering and Sorting**

   **Objective:**

   - Write queries that filter records and sort the result set.

   **Requirements:**

   - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter records based on a condition (e.g., `WHERE Department = 'Sales'`).
   - Apply the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results (e.g., by `LastName` or `Salary`).
   - Experiment with multiple conditions using `AND`/`OR`.

3. **Simple Aggregation and Grouping**

   **Objective:**

   - Summarize data using aggregate functions and grouping.

   **Requirements:**

   - Write a query that uses aggregate functions such as `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, or `AVG()` to calculate totals or averages.
   - Use the `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate data by a specific column (e.g., count the number of employees per department).
   - Optionally, filter grouped results using the `HAVING` clause.

4. **Multi-Table JOINs**

   **Objective:**

   - Combine data from two related tables using JOIN operations.

   **Requirements:**

   - Create two related tables (e.g., `Customers` and `Orders`) with a foreign key relationship.
   - Write an `INNER JOIN` query to retrieve combined information (e.g., customer names along with their order details).
   - Experiment with other types of joins such as `LEFT JOIN` to understand how missing matches are handled.

5. **Subqueries and Nested Queries**

   **Objective:**

   - Use subqueries to filter or compute values within a main query.

   **Requirements:**

   - Write a query that uses a subquery in the `WHERE` clause (e.g., select employees whose salary is above the department’s average salary).
   - Alternatively, use subqueries in the `SELECT` list to compute dynamic columns.
   - Understand the difference between correlated and non-correlated subqueries.

6. **Date and Time Functions**

   **Objective:**

   - Manipulate and query data based on date and time values.

   **Requirements:**

   - Use built-in date functions (e.g., `DATEDIFF`, `DATEADD`, or your SQL dialect’s equivalent) to calculate intervals or adjust dates.
   - Write a query to filter records based on date ranges (e.g., orders placed within the last 30 days).
   - Format date outputs if necessary using functions like `CONVERT` or `TO_CHAR`.

7. **Window Functions and Ranking**

   **Objective:**

   - Leverage window functions to perform calculations across a set of rows.

   **Requirements:**

   - Write a query using window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, or `DENSE_RANK()` to assign ranks (e.g., rank employees by salary within each department).
   - Use `PARTITION BY` to define groups and `ORDER BY` to specify the ranking order.
   - Experiment with other window functions like `LEAD()` or `LAG()` to access adjacent row values.

8. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Recursive Queries**

   **Objective:**

   - Simplify complex queries and process hierarchical data using CTEs.

   **Requirements:**

   - Write a non-recursive CTE to structure a multi-step query for readability (e.g., breaking down a complex aggregation).
   - Create a recursive CTE to display hierarchical data (e.g., an organizational chart or a category tree).
   - Ensure proper termination of the recursive CTE to avoid infinite loops.

9. **Stored Procedures and User-Defined Functions**

   **Objective:**

   - Encapsulate business logic using stored procedures and functions.

   **Requirements:**

   - Create a stored procedure that accepts parameters (e.g., a date range) and returns a result set (such as total sales within that range).
   - Write a scalar or table-valued user-defined function that performs a calculation (e.g., calculates a discount or bonus based on input parameters).
   - Test the procedure and function by calling them and verifying their outputs.

10. **Comprehensive Database Design, Optimization, and Advanced FeaturesObjective:Requirements:**
    - Design a normalized database schema for a complex business scenario (e.g., an eCommerce platform) and implement advanced SQL features to ensure performance, data integrity, and automation.
    - **Schema Design:**
      - Design and create multiple related tables (e.g., `Products`, `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`) with proper primary and foreign keys, unique constraints, and normalization practices.
    - **Indexing and Performance:**
      - Analyze query performance and apply indexing strategies to optimize frequently executed queries.
    - **Triggers:**
      - Implement triggers to enforce business rules automatically (e.g., update inventory levels upon order insertion, log changes to critical tables).
    - **Transactions:**
      - Use transactions (`BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency during multi-step operations (e.g., order processing where multiple tables are updated).
    - **Views and Materialized Views (Optional):**
      - Create views to simplify complex joins and aggregations.
      - Optionally, design materialized views if your SQL dialect supports them to cache expensive query results.
    - **Documentation and Testing:**
      - Document your schema and SQL scripts.
      - Write test queries to demonstrate that all constraints, triggers, and transactions work as intended.
